"""
Real-time coaching engine — Claude Haiku prompt generation.

Three-layer coaching architecture (evaluated each trigger):
  Layer 1 (Self):     Is the user communicating in the right mode for this moment?
  Layer 2 (Audience): Who is this participant and what do they need right now?
  Layer 3 (Group):    When to push, yield, or invite contribution from the group?

Priority and cadence floors
────────────────────────────
  ELM-triggered (ego_threat / consensus_protection / shortcut)  10 s floor
  General cadence (self / group)                                 60 s floor

Both suppressed while user_is_speaking=True (overlay waits 500 ms of
silence after Deepgram is_final before polling this engine).

Fallback
─────────
If Claude Haiku exceeds haiku_timeout_s (default 1.5 s) the engine returns
the last successfully generated CoachingPrompt for that layer, with
is_fallback=True.  The overlay renders a subtle "↻ cached" badge.
If no cached prompt exists yet, None is returned and no prompt is shown.
